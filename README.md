Build ANN model for binary classification
The task is to  perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a mixed-feature dataset and build a simple binary classification neural network using PyTorch. The data is highly imbalanced with missing values.
The whole exercise shouldnâ€™t take a significant amount of time
